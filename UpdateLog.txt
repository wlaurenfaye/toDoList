absolute vs relative units absolut unists=mm/in relative units=em/rm

style the HTML body element     <style> body {background-color: black;} </style>

inherit styles from the body  <style> body {background-color: black; color-green; font-family: monospace;} </style>

--------------------------------- STARTED JAVASCRIPT W3SCHOOLS -------------------------------------------------------------------
document.getElementById("").innerHTML = "hello javascript"; 
-finds HTML element by #id and changes the content of the element to whatever is in double or single quotes

-can also change the src of the element with document.getElementById("").src=""

20:19 27/03/2020

can use to style elements with .style e.g. .style.fontSize="90px";
or display e.g. .style.display="none" / "block";
successfully linked external js file

17:54 28/03/2020

"document.write('')" writes content but eliminated any html before
 window.alert('') gives window alert with content
same as java in declaring var's at the begining, statements are separated with ; - ran in order written
js ignores spaces- use to make code clearer
code blocks in {} -  usually for functions e.g. myFunction()

--- key words ------
break = terminates switch or loop
continue= jumps out of a loop and continues at the top
debugger= stops execution and calls for debugging function
do ... while= executes a block of statements and repeats while a condition is true
for = marks a block of statements to be executed as long as a condition is true
function= declares a function
if ... else = marks a block of statements to be executed depending on a condition
return = exit function
switch = block of statements to be executed depending on different cases
try ... catch = implements error handling to a block of statements
var = declares a variable
--------------------------
fixed value is a literal, varing value is a variable
string is text within '' / ""
computation = evaluation
identifier = a name for a variable/keyword/function/ label and can not start with a number, only a $ / letter/ _ and are case sensitive
- can only be used in subtraction, use camel case

18:23 01/04/2020
multiple var/s can be declared in one line or can span multiple lines using ,
var/s declared without an assigned value are 'undefined'
$ is treated as a letter so $$$ could be a var name
in j query $ means select

15:41 02/04/2020
if the first operand is a string, all operands in the line will be treated as strings
booleans can only have two values: true or false eg (x==y) // returns either true or false
arrays are written in [] and separated by , starting at 0 like java
objects in {} eg var person = {firstName:"lauren",lastNAme:"williams", age:20, eyeColour:"hazel"}; = person has those 4 properties
typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression e.g. typeof "" = string
empty an object by setting it to null, but object will still have its type
----------assignment operators -----------------
// used to assign values to vars //

= // same as
+= // e.g. x += y //same as x = x + y
-= // e.g. x -= y // same as x = x - y
*= // e.g. x *= y // same as x = x * y
/= // e.g. x /= y // same as x = x / y
%= // e.g. x %= y // same as x = x % y

14:37 03/04/2020
------------------functions--------------------
parameters are listed inside () in function definition
arguments are the values revieved by the function when it is called
they behave as local variables
functions can be executed by events, being called from code, or automatically (self invoked)
return = function stops executing 
e.g. function from a statement will return to execute the next code after executing the statement
functions often return a value, which is returned back to the caller
e.g.     var x = myFunction (5 , 6); // function is called, return value will end up in variable "x"
	 function myFunction(a , b) {
		return a * b;		function returns the product of a and b
			}

re learning type conversions with new website

...
let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";

alert( apples + oranges ); // "23", the binary plus concatenates strings


let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";

// both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
alert( +apples + +oranges ); // 5

// the longer variant
// alert( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5

Precedence	Name	Sign
…	…	…
17	unary plus	+
17	unary negation	-
15	multiplication	*
15	division	/
13	addition	+
13	subtraction	-
…	…	…
3	assignment	=
…	…	…

The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b

alert( 2 ** 2 ); // 4  (2 * 2)
alert( 2 ** 3 ); // 8  (2 * 2 * 2)
alert( 2 ** 4 ); // 16 (2 * 2 * 2 * 2)

alert( 4 ** (1/2) ); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root, that's maths)
alert( 8 ** (1/3) ); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)

Increment ++ increases a variable by 1
Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1
Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables

When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++.
The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter.
Prefix will produce a new value in the variable 
postfix will also increments counter but returns the old value (prior to increment)

++/-- can be used inside expressions as well. Their precedence is higher than most other arithmetical operations.

upto: bitwise operators
